# üîê Django Security Review

This document summarizes the HTTPS and security configurations implemented in the **LibraryProject** application.

---

## 1. HTTPS Enforcement

- **SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True**  
  Ensures that all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS, forcing secure connections.

- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**  
  - `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000` ‚Üí Browsers will remember to use HTTPS for 1 year.  
  - `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True` ‚Üí Applies HSTS to all subdomains.  
  - `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True` ‚Üí Allows this domain to be preloaded into browsers for HTTPS enforcement.

---

## 2. Secure Cookies

- **SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True**  
  Ensures session cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.  

- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True**  
  Ensures CSRF cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.  

---

## 3. Secure Headers

- **X_FRAME_OPTIONS = "DENY"**  
  Protects against clickjacking by disallowing framing of the site.  

- **SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True**  
  Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing, enforcing declared content types.  

- **SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True**  
  Enables browser XSS filtering to block reflected cross-site scripting attacks.  

---

## 4. Deployment Configuration

- SSL/TLS certificates (e.g., via **Let‚Äôs Encrypt**) must be configured at the web server level (Nginx, Apache).  
- Example: Nginx configured to serve HTTPS traffic with automatic HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS redirect.  

---

## 5. Testing & Review

- Verified that all forms include `{% csrf_token %}`.  
- Checked headers in browser dev tools ‚Üí confirming presence of HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and NoSniff headers.  
- Cookies verified as **Secure** and **HttpOnly** (Django defaults HttpOnly).  

---

‚úÖ With these measures, the Django application is protected against:  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
- Clickjacking  
- Cookie theft via insecure connections  
- Protocol downgrade attacks
